                    Most infamous Cruisers
                    
                    The Aragon class were three unprotected wooden-built cruisers between 1869 and 1882 for the Spanish Navy and named after historical kingdoms or regions of Spain as they were initially designed as central battery ironclads but modified after construction started, as unprotected masted cruisers, and later completely rearmed.
                    
                    Construction of the Aragon-class cruisers started as armored corvettes and central battery ironclads in 1869. Plans were to buff them with 890 tons of armor, including an armored belt 500 millimeters (19.7 in) thick at the waterline.
                    
                    Has a displacement of 1152 tons, travels at 13 knots, and has a rough crew of 173 people, Steam powered engines.</p>
