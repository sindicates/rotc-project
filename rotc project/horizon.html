                    Both Italy and France replaced their aging destroyers (Audace class destroyers in Italy and Suffren class carrier escorts in France) with the Horizon class. A joint venture between the two countries, the destroyer features the Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS). The destroyer displaces 7,050 tons with a full load and reaches 152 meters in length. A Combined Diesel or Gas (COGAG) propulsion system consisting of two LM2500 gas turbines and two Pielstick diesel engines gives the ship a top speed of 29 knots.
                    
                    The Horizon class destroyer is equipped with sophisticated radar systems for surface/air search, target tracking, and missile guidance. These include the European Multifunction Phased Array Radar (EMPAR), a single-faced passive electronically scanning array radar. For long-range detection and early warning of aerial targets, the ship uses the S1850M L-band volume search PESA radar. The Italian destroyer is fitted with Selex RAN 30X/I for surface search radar.
                    
                    The French and Italian versions differ slightly in armament. Both are equipped with a 48-cell vertical launch system for launching Aster 15 (50+ km range) and Aster 30 (120+ km range) missiles. Eight inclined tube launchers fire Exocet anti-ship missiles on the French ship while eight inclined tube launchers are used for Otomat anti-ship missiles on the Italian destroyer. Both the French and Italian ships have two single torpedo tubes to launch MU90 Impact lightweight torpedoes.</p>
