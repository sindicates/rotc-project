                    These ships were mostly made famous by the Graf Spee in the southern Atlantic, in the first naval battle of WW2, at the river plate in 1939. She somewhat eclipsed the other two: Scheer and Deutschland. Indeed, the three were designed during the “rebirth” of the German Navy and despite the Versailles’s treaty strict limitations, which applied to Germany after the first were lifted after the 1935 Anglo-German naval agreement.
                    
                    -Design 1925 “VIII/30”: Less armor but two twin turrets.
                    
                    The VII/30 walked on Diesel engines for a total output of 24,000 shp providing 21 knots, and two forward 12-in (30.5 cm) main turrets, 2×2 150 mm, 4x 88mm.
                    
                    VIII/35 design also used a Diesel, but output halved at 16,000 shp, for 19 knots, a triple forward 305 mm turret, and 6x 88mm. </p>
