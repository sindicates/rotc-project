                    The most formidable IJN heavy cruisers: The Takao heavy cruiser class included the Takao, Atago, Maya and Chokai. They were were among the very best and most active Japanese cruisers of the Second World War, really outshining all the others. Like the other IJN cruisers of the time, they were extensively rebuilt before 1941 operations, but less extensively than their older counterparts, the Nachi. The most striking aspect was their bulkier appearance, that some argued played in their favor for exceptional resilience. The excellence of their ASW protection was also shown by the amazing survival of IJN Takao after a triple torpedo hit.
                    
                    Four shafts connected to geared turbine fed by 12 Kampon boilers, for a total output of 132,000 shp. This was just a 2,000 shp improvement over the Nachi due to improvements in boiler pressure. Top speed was 34.2â€“35.5 knots as shown on trials, comparable to the Nachi, and a range of 8,500 nautical miles at 14 knots, the same as the previous cruisers. Performances would drop due to the partial reconstruction and addition of armaments made in the late 1930s and WW2.</p>
