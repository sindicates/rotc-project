                    The Kolkata class destroyers play a key role in India's navy as a deterrent to potentially aggressive adversaries. These destroyers were designed and constructed using state-of-the-art components from sources all over the world. With a displacement of 7,500 tons, the destroyer measures 534 feet long. Has a top speed of 30 knots. The Kolkata class destroyer has a range of 6,000 nautical miles at 18 knots.
                    
                    The strength of the Kolkata class destroyer's offensive capability can be attributed to its Vertical Launch System, a shipborne missile canister capable of rapid-fire deployment of long-range surface-to-air missiles, anti-ship missiles, and land-attack cruise missiles. The weaponry includes the BrahMos
                    
                    supersonic missile, the fastest cruise missile in the world with a top speed of Mach 2.5 to Mach 2.8.
                    
                    The destroyer's defense features the MF-STAR multi-function radar for surface and air search, tracking, missile guidance, and gunnery. A Thales LW-08 2D radar provides long-range surveillance. The Barak 8 surface-to-air missile system defends against aerial threats, such as aircraft, helicopters, and incoming missiles. The system is capable of intercepting high-altitude targets as well as supersonic sea-skimming anti-ship missiles.</p>
