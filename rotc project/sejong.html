                    Sejong the Great class destroyers are designed and built with exceptional technology. These warships are perhaps best distinguished by their unparalleled stealth technology, carefully designed to minimize radar cross-section and infrared signatures.
                    
                    Measuring 165 meters long, the destroyer has a full load displacement of 10,000 tons making it one of the world's largest destroyers. The ship is powered by a combined gas and gas turbine (COGAG) propulsion system that sends 75 MW of power to two shafts and two controllable pitch propellers, resulting in a top speed of over 30 knots. The Republic of Korea Navy operates three Sejong the Great class destroyers.
                    
                    The Sejong the Great class destroyers use the Lockheed Aegis weapon system which includes SPY-1 radar, the MK 99 fire control system, and the MK-41 vertical launching system. The system tracks multiple targets such as aircraft or missiles and responds to these threats. The destroyer is also equipped with the Goalkeeper close-in weapon system (CIWS), anti-submarine rockets, and torpedoes. The massive destroyer can carry two Super Lynx or SH-60 Seahawk helicopters. It also packs more firepower than other dominant destroyers, with 128 missiles compared to 96 missiles on the Arleigh Burke class.</p>
